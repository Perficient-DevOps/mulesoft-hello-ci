/*
This pipeline build example is for a Nodejs application.  The stages within this pipeline will build the app, package the app
into a zip file, perform a Nexus IQ scan, then call a downstream job to deploy the app to an environment.  These builds are
considered to be throw away as no GIT tag is created and the build is not stored in Nexus Repo.  This build is intended to
be a developer quick test.
